# Benford's Law

Benford's law is an observation about the frequency distribution of leading digits in many real-life sets of numerical data. The law states that in many naturally occurring collections of numbers, the leading digit is likely to be small. In sets that obey the law, the number 1 appears as the leading significant digit about 30 % of the time, while 9 appears as the leading significant digit less than 5 % of the time. If the digits were distributed uniformly, they would each occur about 11.1 % of the time.

In this application, I used a summary of of 2018 airline ticket prices. It consisted of airfares for over 1,000,000 flights (origin/destination).

You can see it closely resembles the curve, albeit at slightly different values.
